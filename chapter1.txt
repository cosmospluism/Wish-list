Title: Charlie and The Candy Factory 

chapter 1

The house wasnâ€™t nearly large enough for so many people, and life was extremely uncomfortable for them all. There were only two rooms in the place altogether, and there was only one bed. The bed was given to the four old grandparents because they were so old and tired. They were so tired, they never got out of it.

happily ever after.
what the hell!!!!
